# Masters-Thesis-Code
This repository contains the code for my Master's thesis at the University of Leoben, Austria and in collaboration with the Colorado School of Mines, Golden, Colorado, USA. 
The thesis' goal is to model the thermodynamic properties Gibbs energy, entropy, enthalpy and heat-capacity using Neural networks. 

## Data Handling
Data Handling contains all files for handling the data used for training the Neural Nets. This is mainly containing data from thermodynanmic databases like the SGTE data. In Data
Handling, there are multiple scripts that extract data from those databases. 

## Neural Nets
Neural Nets contains the neural networks used to approximate the thermodynamic functions. It contains both the network published in "An artificial neural network model for the unary description of pure iron" by LÃ¤nge (https://doi.org/10.1007/s00500-019-04663-3) and a network developed by myself.
